# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! As a Senior Data Analyst with a growing passion for software engineering, I'll be sharing my journey and insights at the intersection of data analytics, engineering, and modern web development.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Data Analytics & Visualization
- Data Engineering & ETL Pipelines
- Modern Web Development
- Cloud Technologies & DevOps
- Career Growth & Technical Learning
- And much more!

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a Python data processing function:

```python
def process_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Clean and transform data for analysis
    """
    return (
        df
        .dropna()
        .assign(
            date=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x['date']),
            value=lambda x: x['value'].astype(float)
        )
        .groupby('category')
        .agg({'value': ['mean', 'sum']})
    )
```

## Stay Tuned

I'm excited to share my experiences in data analytics and my journey into software engineering. Whether you're a data professional looking to expand into software development or vice versa, I hope my content will be helpful. Stay tuned for more posts!
